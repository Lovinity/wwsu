# WWSU 4.5.0
The WWSU Radio Sails.js API application enables external / remote control of core WWSU functionality. Applications can be developed utilizing this API. 

## Websockets
Several of the API endpoints, as noted in their respective section of this documentation, can be called using a socket request. When the request is a socket, the client will be subscribed to receive changes. Unless otherwise specified, all websocket messages are sent as an event containing the same name as the top level endpoint, in all lowercase (For example, anything under Messages will be sent as a socket event named "messages"). The data sent to the event follows the following format, designed to be used in conjunction with nedb:
### Insert
    {
        "insert": {
            // Attributes of the created record, including the ID, will be contained here.
        }
    }
### Update
    {
        "update": {
            // Attributes of the updated record will be contained here. Clients are advised to use update.ID as the "where" when updating records.
        }
    }
### Remove
    {
        "remove": 1 // The ID number of the record to be removed
    }
**Endpoints in this documentation which indicate they support sockets and do not specify a format are assumed to use the above standard.**
## Responses
All API endpoints explained below will respond with something. In addition to the responses documented in the respective sections, endpoints may also respond with any of the following:

 - 400 An error object, containing code (string), problems (array of strings), and message (string).
 - 401 `{"err": "Invalid Token!"}`
 - 403 `{"discipline": "Your interactions with WWSU have been placed under review. Please email engineer@wwsu1069.org for further assistance. Please include the following reference number(s) in your email: (reference numbers here separated by comma)"}` 
 - 404 "Not Found"
 - 500 Internal Server Error
## Methods
The WWSU app does not care which method you use for any of the requests. Generally, it is recommended to use GET when fetching information, and POST when submitting information.
## Hosts and Authorization
A lot of API endpoints require a valid authorization in the form of a header. The endpoints which require authorization will be noted in their respective section.
 - The key is "authorization", and the value is "Bearer (token)". 
 - Use the /hosts/get endpoint to authenticate and get a token.
### /hosts/edit
Edit a host. **Requires authorization**
 - A request to edit a host will be blocked if the provided admin or authorized parameter is false, and there are 1 or less authorized admin hosts. This is to prevent accidental lockout from the system.
 - Modifying the "host" (host name) is not implemented; this should never change as it is based off of the client / device and not something configured.
#### Request
| key | criteria |
|--|--|
| ID | number (required; ID of the host record to edit.) |
| friendlyname | string (optional; if provided, the friendly name of this host will be modified to what is provided.) |
| authorized | boolean (optional; if provided, whether or not the host is authorized (receives a token for restricted endpoints) will be changed to this. If false, and 1 or less authorized admin hosts exist, the edit request will be denied to prevent accidental lockout.) |
| admin | boolean (optional; if provided, whether or not the host is an admin (should have access to admin settings in DJ Controls) will be changed to this. If false, and 1 or less authorized admin hosts exist, the edit request will be denied to prevent accidental lockout.) |
| requests | boolean (optional; if provided, whether or not this host should be notified of new track requests will be changed to this.) |
| emergencies | boolean (optional; if provided, whether or not this host should be notified of system problems will be changed to this.) |
| webmessages | boolean (optional; if provided, whether or not this host should be notified of messages sent from the web / mobile app will be changed to this.) |
#### Response 200 OK
#### Response 409 Conflict (This is thrown when the request was blocked to prevent accidental lockout)
### /hosts/get
Retrieve information about a host. 
 - If the host does not exist in the database, it will be created with default settings. However, it will not be authorized, and therefore a token will not be returned. An admin will need to authorize the host for it to begin using tokens to hit endpoints requiring authorization. 
 - If the host exists and is authorized, an authorization token will be generated and returned.
 - This endpoint supports sockets, uses the "hosts" event, and returns data in the structure defined in the websockets section. A request will only be subscribed if the provided host is an authorized admin.
#### Request
| key | criteria |
|--|--|
| host | string (required; name of the host to retrieve or create.) |

            "requests": true, // If true, this client should notify of track requests even when this host was not used to go live
            "emergencies": false, // If true, this client should notify of reported technical issues
            "webmessages": true, // If true, this client should notify of messages sent by public clients, even when this host was not used to go live
            "token": null, // If the host is authorized, a token will be provided here for use in the headers of endpoints requiring authorization. The token will expire after 1 hour. Otherwise, this will be null.
            "otherHosts": [], // If this host is an authorized admin, an array of all the hosts in the database will be provided for administration purposes. Otherwise, this property will not exist.
        }
### /hosts/remove
Removes a host from the database.
 - A request to remove a host will be blocked if the host to remove is the only authorized admin host in the system. This is to prevent accidental lockout from the system.

## Messages

### /messages/get-web
Retrieve a list of messages sent within the last hour applicable to web and mobile users.
 - **NOTE:** new clients should call recipients/add-web in order to show up as online to other clients and to receive any stored nicknames for this client as response.label.
 - This endpoint supports sockets. When called by a socket, the client will be subscribed to multiple events:
 - - The "messages" event receives new/updated/deleted messages using the structure defined in the websockets section.
 - - The "discipline" event receives data when discipline has been issued to the client. The data received is `{"discipline": "A message regarding the discipline issued"}`. When discipline is issued, several endpoints will respond with a 403 until the discipline expires.

# WWSU 4.0.alpha
The WWSU Radio Sails.js API application enables external / remote control of core WWSU functionality. Applications can be developed utilizing this API. 

This application was re-developed from the version 3 application using Sails.js v1. Currently, this is in Alpha stage, which means not everything from version 3 has been ported to version 4 yet. Furthermore, this should be considered a non-working build until Beta stage.

## Websockets
Several of the API endpoints, as noted in their respective section of this documentation, can be called using a socket request. When the request is a socket, the client will be subscribed to receive changes. Unless otherwise specified, all websocket messages are sent as an event containing the same name as the top level endpoint, in all lowercase (For example, anything under Messages will be sent as a socket event named "messages"). The data sent to the event follows the following format, designed to be used in conjunction with nedb:
### Insert

    {
	    "insert": {
		    // Attributes of the created record, including the ID, will be contained here.
		}
	}
### Update

    {
	    "update": {
		    // Attributes of the updated record will be contained here. Clients are advised to use update.ID as the "where" when updating records.
	    }
	}
### Remove

    {
	    "remove": 1 // The ID number of the record to be removed
	}
**Endpoints in this documentation which indicate they support sockets and do not specify a format are assumed to use the above standard.**
## Responses
All API endpoints explained below will respond with something. In addition to the responses documented in the respective sections, endpoints may also respond with any of the following:

 - 400 An error object, containing code (string), problems (array of strings), and message (string).
 - 401 `{"err": "Invalid Token!"}`

 - 404 "Not Found"
 - 500 Internal Server Error

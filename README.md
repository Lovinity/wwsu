# WWSU 6.0.0 ALPHA 31
The WWSU Radio Sails.js API application enables external / remote control of core WWSU functionality. Applications can be developed utilizing this API. 

**Version 6.0.0 will remain in ALPHA stage for a long while due to Summer semester rapid development. The API is tentative and subject to change at any time in 6.0.0. Be sure to keep an eye on documentation.**

**The master branch should NOT be used for your own deployment and should be considered unstable; please use a release instead**

Please check out the GitHub wiki for the API documentation.

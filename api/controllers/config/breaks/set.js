You MUST NOT have any intervals between breaks that are less than this. For example, if this is 10, and you have a break at 25 and another at 30 (5 minute difference), this will cause problems. The "0" break ignores this setting since it is required by the FCC. It has its own hard-coded check of 10 minutes that cannot be configured.`

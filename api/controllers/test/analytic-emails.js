          <p>Here is the weekly analytic report for on-air programming.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Top 3 shows/remotes/prerecords for this week:</strong>
          <ul>
          <li>1. ${weekly.topShows[ 0 ]}</li>
          <li>2. ${weekly.topShows[ 1 ]}</li>
          <li>3. ${weekly.topShows[ 2 ]}</li>
          </ul>
          Top 3 shows are calculated based on listener:showtime ratio, web messages sent/received (interactivity), number of breaks taken in an hour (4 is best), and reputation (followed all on-air regulations, did show on-time, etc)</p>

          <p><strong>Top Playlist of the week:</strong> ${weekly.topPlaylist}</p>

          <p><strong>Track requests placed on the website:</strong> ${weekly.tracksRequested}</p>
          <p><strong>Messages sent/received between listeners and DJs:</strong> ${weekly.webMessagesExchanged}</p>

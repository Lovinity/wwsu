## [Unreleased]
### Deprecated
 - As of version 5.0.0, hosts/get will no longer return authorization tokens. Instead, a new group of auth/* endpoints will be used. README.md has more information.
 - As of version 5.0.0, directors/get and djs/get will no longer return the "login" property.
 - As of version 5.0.0, directors/get will no longer use "username" parameter. Instead, optional "name" parameter can be provided to return only the director whose name matches the provided name.
 - As of version 5.0.0, Some endpoints as indicated in README.md will reject on HTTP requests and begin requiring the request to be made via websocket.
 - As of version 5.0.0, "host" will be required in the header when requesting to establish a websocket connection, except for requests originating from server.wwsu1069.org. The host parameter should include a Hosts.host who is authorized (authorized=true). Otherwise, the websocket request will be rejected.
 - As of version 5.0.0, calendar/verify will be removed.
 - As of version 5.0.0, clients must call a new state/sports-remote endpoint for remote sports broadcasts; the "remote" parameter will be removed from state/sports. state/sports-remote will have the same request parameters as state/sports.

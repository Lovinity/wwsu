# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file as of version 4.5.0.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) as of version 4.5.0.

## [unreleased]
## Added
 - "device" parameter to recipients. This will contain the OneSignal UUID if the recipient is using the WWSU mobile app. Otherwise, it will be null.

### Changed
 - Many of the methods used in api controllers and in models have been migrated to sails helpers.
 - Removed a lot of the logging that could potentially output sensitive data to the console.
 - "calendar" model now uses nodebase datastore instead of RAM. This is so we can persist-store event cancellations (which would not be done through Google Calendar).
 - "active" parameter of calendar events will now be false either if the event passed the end time, or if the event was marked as canceled.

## [5.1.0] - 2019-03-15
### Deprecated
 - /discipline/ban-day, /discipline/ban-indefinite, and /discipline/ban-show. Use /discipline/add instead. These endpoints will be removed in version 6.0.0.
 - sails.helpers.discipline.banDay, sails.helpers.discipline.banIndefinite, and sails.helpers.discipline.banShow. Use sails.helpers.discipline.add instead. These helpers will be removed in version 6.0.0.

### Added
 - /auth/* endpoints, upon successful authorization, will also return expires property in addition to token property. Expires is how long the token is valid for, in milliseconds.
 - Slides.countActive() in wwsu-slides.js for counting the number of active slides currently.
 - /recipients/register-peer for DJ Controls connecting to Peerjs to report their peerjs ID to the system.
 - Helper break.executeArray for executing an array of break objects through break.execute. [Issue 54](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/54)
 - /discipline/get, /discipline/edit, /discipline/add, and /discipline/remove for modifying discipline records in the system. [Issue 29](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/29)
 - sails.helpers.discipline.add to replace the three other discipline helpers.
 - Unauthorized Shows, Remotes, and Sports broadcasts that start will be logged under the "unauthorized" logtype.

### Changed
 - /silence/active and /silence/inactive now must be called with a valid socket and an authorized host.
 - /silence/active and /silence/inactive no longer take any input parameters; key was removed.
 - /display/public events 2-4 and 5-7 slides deactivated for now to conserve on information.
 - EAS alerts originating from NWS that are no longer being reported by CAPS (such as canceled) will not be removed from the system for 5 more minutes because of a potential bug if removed immediately.
 - Breaks during live shows, remotes, and sports broadcasts now configured in sails.config.custom.specialBreaks. [Issue 54](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/54)

### Fixed
 - sails.helpers.recipients.add bug adding all computer recipients to Status instead of only the ones we want to track.
 - Listener's corner is more responsive on mobile devices.
 - Host request in wwsu.js fails for non-authentication requests. [Issue 62](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/62)
 - Changing announcement type caused display slides to not be removed when they should have been. Now, when announcement type is changed, a websocket remove is sent to the previous type.
 - If an unscheduled show is on the air and happens to later fall within a scheduled timeframe, its attendance record will be updated accordingly. [Issue 66](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/66)

### Removed
 - Removed the frozenRemote status errorCheck as we are favoring webRTC audio calls for remote broadcasts instead of shoutcast.
 - Removed all instances of queuing a remote broadcast track for remote_on and sportsremote_on since we are using webRTC via DJ Controls now.

## [5.0.2] - 2019-02-02
### Added
 - wwsu-slides.js for managing display sign slides
 - displayTime to announcements and relevant endpoints; used to specify the amount of time in seconds the announcement should display on display signs and on the web. Defaults to 15. Must be between 5 and 60.

### Changed
 - Display Internal now uses material design and wwsu-slides.js
 - Display Public now uses material design and wwsu-slides.js

## Fixed
 - Attempted to fix a bug where new NWS alerts were being pushed to websockets containing only the first county issued. Now, it should wait until all counties are processed.
 - Uncaught length bug in truncateText helper.

## [5.0.1] - 2019-01-27
### Deprecated
 - sails.helpers.songs.remove includeCurrentTrack parameter never worked correctly and will instead be used by something else. This parameter will now be ignored. It will be removed in 6.0.0.
 - Songs.pendingCmd; it will be removed in 6.0.0.
 - Parameter "queue" in sails.helpers.rest.cmd; it will be removed in 6.0.0.

### Added
 - lastSeen column in Djs model that updates to current datetime when a DJ does a show. [Issue 55](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/55)
 - config.custom.queueCorrection and checks in the state/* endpoints for checking queue lengths, and removing / skipping tracks if the queue is too long to get shows on sooner. [Issue 53](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/53)
 - optional oldQueue parameter in sails.helpers.error.post. If provided as array of RadioDJ Meta.automation queue, this will be re-queued in the new RadioDJ. [Issue 50](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/50)
 - optional queue parameter in sails.helpers.songs.queue. If true, the helper Promise will not be resolved until it has been confirmed that the track was queued in RadioDJ (or an error is thrown after 10 seconds).
 - optional queue parameter in sails.helpers.songs.queuePending. If true, the helper Promise will not be resolved until it has been confirmed that the tracks were queued in RadioDJ (or an error is thrown after 10 seconds).
 - task.rules in sails.config.custom.breaks for the queue task. If true, tracks will be checked against playlist rotation rules.
 - sails.helpers.breaks.execute for executing configured break objects. [Issue 54](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/54)
 - Songs.queueCheck to monitor for tracks we want to ensure were queued before resolving.
 - sails.helpers.rest.checkQueue with parameter ID (track ID). When called, the helper will return with a Promise that does not resolve until sails.helpers.rest.getQueue confirms the track was queued.

## [5.0.0] - 2019-01-25
### Deprecated
 - Meta.djcontrols will soon be removed from meta/get (but will still exist internally). This property will be removed in 6.0.0. For now, it will just return an empty string all the time. Clients are advised to use their own internal checking.
 - sails.helpers.playlists.start resume parameter has been deprecated and will be ignored. The parameter will be removed in version 6.0.0.

### Added
 - Websocket policies; socket requests not originating from server.wwsu1069.org must provide a host query parameter, which is an authorized host (see Hosts). [Issue 24](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/24)
 - Added makeCalls, answerCalls, silenceDetection, and recordAudio options to hosts. [Issue 42](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/42)
 - state/sports-remote for remote sports broadcasts.
 - uab/directors/add, uab/directors/edit, uab/directors/get, and uab/directors/remove endpoints. Also, Uabdirectors model. This is used for UAB timesheet system. [Issue 40](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/40)
 - uab/timesheet/add, uab/timesheet/edit, uab/timesheet/get and uab/timesheet/view endpoints. Also, Uabtimesheet model. This is used for UAB timesheet system. [Issue 40](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/40)
 - sails.config.custom.startOfSemester, which should be configured every semester so that remote credit calculations are by semester.
 - For ending live shows, state/automation now also returns properties remoteCredits (number of credits the DJ has this semester), totalShowTime (total overall airtime in minutes), and totalListenerMinutes (total listener minutes during all shows).
 - announcements/add-problem . This endpoint should be used instead of announcements/add when reporting technical issues with WWSU.

### Changed
 - The authorization procedure of many endpoints has changed. See the readme file carefully for instructions on authorization and which endpoints require which type of authorization. [Issue 9](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/9)
 - Calling hosts/get with a host that does not exist no longer creates a new host in the database. This now happens via initial websocket connection requests.
 - The secret used for website host IP IDs no longer changes on each reboot; this is now set via sails.config.custom.hostSecret.
 - DJ Controls hosts are no longer monitored / configured in sails.config.custom. Instead, they are monitored in Status based off of the hosts in the database. [Issue 42](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/42)
 - DJ "name" column and director "name" column now must be unique.
 - Directors/get now takes optional name parameter; username (login) parameter was removed.
 - Directors login column no longer accepts null; a value must be provided.
 - Calls to directors/edit where parameter admin=false will be rejected if there are 1 or less admin directors in the system; this is to prevent accidental lockout.
 - Directors login column and dj login column will store logins as bcrypt factor 13 instead of plaintext.
 - Attendance/get response array will now be sorted by actualStart ASC if not null, else scheduledStart ASC if not null, else ID ASC. createdAt was inefficient for some records.
 - xp/get now returns as an object {startOfSemester: "ISO date string", data: []}. See README.md for more information.
 - Timesheet editing via timesheet/view re-implemented with admin director authentication. [Issue 1](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/1)
 - announcements/add and announcements/edit takes danger, warning, info, or trivial for the level parameter. The announcements model does the same. [Issue 48](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/48)
 - errorCheck trigger time for frozen and queueFail increased from 15 to 30 seconds due to conflict with playlist queuing. [Issue 51](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/51)
 - listener's corner uses Material design.
 - Due to HTML complications, listener's corner shows chat, schedule, and request system all without the menu.
 - Due to JQuery complications, listener's corner uses iziModal instead of Material Design / Bootstrap modals.

### Removed
 - hosts/get no longer returns authorization tokens. [Issue 9](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/9)
 - Directors/get no longer returns the login property. The property is also no longer given in websockets.
 - Removed "host" parameter from messages/get, recipients/add-computers... and "from" parameter from messages/send. Uses the host authorized from the provided auth/host token instead.
 - Removed "djcontrols" parameter from state/live, state/remote, and state/sports. Will use the host authorized from the provided auth/host token instead.
 - Removed "remote" parameter from state/sports; use new state/sports-remote instead.
 - Removed "login" parameter from timesheet/add; uses the director authorized from the provided auth/director token instead.
 - Removed user.verify helper; no longer needed as verification will happen inside the policies.
 - state/automation no longer returns the "listeners" array property.

### Fixed
 - Internal Server Error on djs/add. [Issue 46](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/46).
 - Listener minutes calculations in Attendance not accurate. [Issue 47](https://github.com/Lovinity/wwsu/issues/47)
 - sanitize helper was changing & to &amp;.
 - EAS processes "This alert has expired"; these should be skipped.

 - As of version 5.0.0, calendar/verify will be removed.
 - As of version 5.0.0, clients must call a new state/sports-remote endpoint for remote sports broadcasts; the "remote" parameter will be removed from state/sports. state/sports-remote will have the same request parameters as state/sports.

  /*
   * BREAKS
   */

  /*
   * Configuration format
   *
   * Each break is configured as follows, based on an hourly clock wheel:
   * minuteNumber: [array of option objects] (for example, 0: [] will execute at around the top of every hour... 20: [] will execute at around :20 past every hour.
   * NOTE: A 0 (top of the hour) break is REQUIRED by the FCC and by this application. You must have an entry for a 0 break in the breaks configuration.
   *
   * Each break contains an array of option objects (0: [array of option objects]). Here are the options you can use:
   *
   * // This adds an info log entry under automation.
   * {task: "log", event: "What to log"}
   *
   * // This queues up to (quantity) number of requested tracks, and adds a request liner (categories.requestLiners) at the beginning (if any requests were queued).
   * {task: "queueRequests", quantity: 1}
   *
   * // Queues (quantity) number of tracks from (category) as configured in the categories section. If rules is true, tracks will be checked against playlist rotation rules.
   * {task: "queue", category: "categoryName (from the categories configuration)", quantity: 1, rules: true}
   *
   * // If any underwritings etc were removed from the queue due to duplicates, they get stored in memory. This re-queues them. It is advised to have this in every break.
   * {task: "queueDuplicates"}
   *
   * NOTE: everything is executed in REVERSE (items from the end of the array happen before the items in the beginning). But this works out because that way,
   * queued tracks end up in the order you specified. For example, if you put PSAs before an ID in the array, the PSAs will be above the IDs in RadioDJ, and will play first.
   *
   * Example:
   *
   * // The "20" means this break will queue around minute 20 of every hour
   * 20: [
   *         {task: "queue", category: "PSAs", quantity: 2}, // This queues 2 tracks that fall within the configured categories.PSAs tracks
   *         {task: "queueDuplicates"}, // This adds any underwritings etc that were previously removed from the queue due to duplicates
   *         {task: "queue", category: "sweepers", quantity: 1}, // This queues 1 sweeper (track configured in categories.sweepers)
   *         {task: "queueRequests", quantity: 3} // This queues up to 3 requested tracks, and adds a request liner (categories.requestLiners) at the beginning.
   *         {task: "queueUnderwritings", quantity: 2} // Queue up to quantity number of scheduled underwritings. Quantity may be ignored if there are more underwritings way behind schedule.
   *     ],
   *
   * // This break and set of options will queue at around :40 past every hour. We won't give another array of options example as it is redundant.
   * 40: [...]
   */

  /*
   * How Breaks Work (automation, playlists, genres, and prerecords)
   *
   * Breaks do NOT queue exactly at the configured minute every hour. Instead, the system uses intelligent guessing to determine when to queue them.
   * The primary goal is to queue breaks in such a way they are as on-time as possible, even if they have to queue a little early/late.
   * The secondary goal is to avoid having multiple breaks getting queued back to back.
   * NOTE: With the exception of the 0 break, which is never skipped... breaks may be skipped if necessary to prevent duplicate break queuing.
   *
   * Logic chart for determining when to queue breaks:
   *
   * For each configured break, checked every second by the cron.js "checks" CRON:
   *
   * Current minute past the hour is < scheduled break minute, OR the break we are checking for is the 0 break (top of hour breaks should never be skipped).
   *     Yes v     No > exit / do not queue; if this happens and the break was never queued for this hour, it is skipped until the next hour.
   * Previous break was queued >= breakCheck (in configuration) minutes ago (0 break always uses 10 minutes regardless of breakCheck, and is compared to the previous 0 break only)
   *     Yes v     No > exit / do not queue at this time.
   * Current playing track remaining time is < breakCheck minutes (0 break always uses 10 minutes regardless of breakCheck)
   *     Yes v     No > exit / do not queue at this time.
   * Current playing track will finish after the scheduled break time
   *     No v      Yes > queue the break and exit. Break will air after the current track is finished. In this case, the break usually airs a little past scheduled time.
   * Current track will finish before scheduled break, and next track will finish after. But between being late and being early, break would be more late than it would early.
   *     No v      Yes > queue the break and exit. Break will air after the current track is finished and before the next one... a little early compared to its scheduled time.
   * Exit (do not queue the break at this time)
